## About me
As a junior software engineer from Spain, I am excited to work in the industry I love. I am a natural-born problem-solver and am passionate about approaching challenges from different points of view to find creative solutions.

## My story
As a child, I was fortunate to attend technology summer camps which sparked my interest in technology. I enjoyed tearing apart old toys for spare motors and building Lego robots, and through these activities, I discovered my passion for software engineering.

## My skills
I am skilled in a wide range of areas and am able to quickly learn and adapt to new tools. However, my main skills lie in frontend and server-side development, as I have professional experience in both. I am currently working on a personal web3 project which allows me to further develop my skills.

## My favorite quality
One of my favorite qualities as a software engineer is my problem-solving skills. However, I believe my most important quality is my initiative and passion for learning new things in tech. I am constantly seeking out opportunities to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date on the latest developments in the industry.
